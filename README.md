## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### I'm Paul! I am a software engineer based in Dallas, Texas ðŸ¤ 

I've been working on full stack projects professionally for 3 years now. The technologies I use daily are Angular with Typescript, Spring Boot, and Oracle SQL database. I really enjoy getting to work every level of the application and creating new features using vertical slice architecture!

I enjoy experimenting with new projects and technologies during my free time and look forward to creating many new projects in the future

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: LouTrails, an informational website to find different trails for hiking, biking, or more - in Louisville!
