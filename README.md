## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### I'm Paul! I am a software engineer based in Dallas, Texas ðŸ¤ 

I've been working on full stack projects professionally for 2 years now. The technologies I use daily are Angular with Typescript, Spring Boot, and Oracle SQL database. I really enjoy getting to work every level of the application and creating new features using vertical slice architecture!

I'm currently exploring and experimenting with ReactJs and NodeJs during my free time and look forward to creating many new personal projects in the future
