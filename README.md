## Hi there 👋

### I'm Paul! I am a software engineer based in Louisville, Kentucky 🐎

I've been working on full stack projects professionally for **4 years** now. I have a passion for creating modern applications with an emphasis on front-end or full-stack development. I am particularly interested in all things **Javascript/Typescript** and greatly enjoy getting to work with **React** and **Angular**. 

I enjoy experimenting with new projects and technologies during my free time and look forward to creating many new projects in the future

Check out my most recent project: ***[2048Clone](https://2048gameclone.netlify.app/)***!
